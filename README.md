# White Box Dev (klaytonkowalski)

I share many of my personal software projects here. All of them at least *somewhat* documented, such that anybody well-versed in the topic could understand the purpose of the repository and perhaps read and understand the code.

Respositories are organized by the following prefixes:

| Prefix | Description | More |
| ------ | ----------- | ---- |
| library- | Library that developers can link against or include in their own projects. | |
| example- | Example of some algorithm or solution that developers can learn from. | These are either companion repositories for YouTube videos or file dumps for some topic that I was learning about. They are not intended to serve as stand-alone tutorials. |
| tutorial- | Step-by-step text-based tutorials. | These are what you might find in a programming-related blog. They are intended to serve as stand-alone tutorials and oftentimes come equipped with demos and other learning resources. |

Please click the â˜† button on GitHub if the repository is useful or interesting. Thank you!
