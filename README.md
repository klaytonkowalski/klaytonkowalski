# White Box Dev

Welcome to my GitHub profile! This is where I share some of my personal programming projects. Most of them are related to game development.

Documentation is very important to me. If a codebase is difficult to navigate or understand, then it becomes increasingly close to a black-box system, which hinders many of the benefits of open-source software. My repositories are documented at least enough to explain why they exist and what problem they solve. Some of my repositories are more thoroughly documented, such that a skilled developer on the topic can understand and potentially contribute to the codebase.

Respositories are organized by the following prefixes:

| Prefix | Description | More |
| ------ | ----------- | ---- |
| library- | Libraries that developers can link against or include in their own projects. | |
| example- | Examples of algorithms or solutions that developers can learn from. | These are either companion repositories to my YouTube videos or file dumps that others may find insightful. |
| tutorial- | Step-by-step text-based tutorials. | These are what you might find in a programming-related blog. These are intended to serve as stand-alone tutorials and often come equipped with demos and other learning resources. |

Please click the â˜† button on GitHub if the repository is useful or interesting. Thank you!
