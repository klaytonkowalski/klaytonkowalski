# White Box Dev

Welcome! This is where I share some of my personal programming projects. Most of them are related to game development.

**In May 2024, I decided to retire this account. Future commits and repositories will be extremely rare or nonexistent, however I will continue to accept pull requests if necessary.**

Respositories are organized by the following prefixes:

| Prefix | Description | More |
| ------ | ----------- | ---- |
| library- | Libraries that developers can link against or include in their own projects. | |
| example- | Examples of algorithms or solutions that developers can learn from. | These are either companion repositories to my YouTube videos or file dumps that others may find insightful. |
| tutorial- | Step-by-step text-based tutorials. | These are what you might find in a programming-related blog. These are intended to serve as stand-alone tutorials and often come equipped with demos and other learning resources. |

Please click the â˜† button on GitHub if the repository is useful or interesting. Thank you!
