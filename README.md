# White Box Dev

Welcome to my GitHub profile! This is where I share some of my personal programming projects. Most of them are related to game development because much of my free time is spent making games, libraries for other game developers, and game development tutorials.

Documentation is very important to me. I believe that any open-source software is only as good as its documentation. If a codebase is difficult to navigate or understand, then it becomes increasingly close to a black-box system, which actively works against many of the benefits of open-source software. My repositories are documented at least enough to explain why they exist and what problem they are solving. Some of my repositories are more thoroughly documented, such that any developer knowledgable on the topic can understand and potentially contribute to the codebase.

Respositories are organized by the following prefixes:

| Prefix | Description | More |
| ------ | ----------- | ---- |
| library- | Libraries that developers can link against or include in their own projects. | |
| example- | Examples of algorithms or solutions that developers can learn from. | These are either companion repositories for YouTube videos or file dumps for some topic that I was learning about. They are not intended to serve as stand-alone tutorials. |
| tutorial- | Step-by-step text-based tutorials. | These are what you might find in a programming-related blog. They are intended to serve as stand-alone tutorials and often come equipped with demos and other learning resources. |

Please click the â˜† button on GitHub if the repository is useful or interesting. Thank you!
