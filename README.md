# White Box Dev (klaytonkowalski)

I share many of my personal software projects here. All of my open-source projects are at least *somewhat* documented, such that anybody well-versed in the topic could understand the purpose of the repository and perhaps read and understand the code.

Respositories are organized by the following prefixes:

| Prefix | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| library- | Library that developers can link against or include in their own projects. |
| example- | Example of some implementation that developers can learn from. These are finished solutions, not step-by-step tutorials. |
| tutorial- | Step-by-step text-based tutorial. |

Please click the â˜† button on GitHub if the repository is useful or interesting. Thank you!
